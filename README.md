# *S*tupid *F*ast *S*coop *U*tils

Super fast replacements and additions to scoop commands written in Rust

## Installation

```powershell
scoop bucket add extras

scoop install sfsu
```

## Hook

You may set up the hooks to use the scoop commands normally

Add the following to your Powershell profile

```powershell
Invoke-Expression (&sfsu hook)
```

You can also optionally disable certain hooks via the `--disable <COMMAND>` flag

```powershell
Invoke-Expression (&sfsu hook --disable list)
```

## Benchmarks

On average, `sfsu search` is **~1200** times faster than regular `scoop search` and ~7 times faster than [scoop-search](https://github.com/shilangyu/scoop-search)

`sfsu list` is ~4 times faster than `scoop list`

Done on a _AMD Ryzen 7 2700X @ 4.3GHz_ with _16GB_ of RAM and 17 scoop buckets listed below

## Long Term Goals

Currently I am considering creating an entire Scoop alternative that has 100% interoperability with existing Scoop buckets, but way way way faster than Scoop.

In the meantime I will continue working on this independently of Scoop as "seperate" tools that work without an entire package manager.
